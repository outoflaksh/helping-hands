<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Helping Hands was created in an attempt to alleviate the problems of modern slavery. Even in the present, progressive state of society, poor workers and laborers are forced to work irregular hours, with no safety equipments, and are paid irrational wages - that in no way compensates for their efforts. They do not even have a voice to fight this injustice and live a very difficult life.

### Enter, Helping Hands
- An application where laborers and poor workers can register themselves to provide their services. 
- Clients can post the requirements of the job they need done and registered workers can browse through and select a suitable job to work on.
- Every worker will be salaried on a biweekly basis and would get extra commission on each job they work at.
- The app bills the client directly on the basis of the number of workers, the work, and the time provided to complete the job.
- Helping Hands also ensures that the workers will have rational work hours and will be compensated fairly.


*Note: Helping Hands was created as a submission for IIT-D's 404!! Resolved Hackathon, where it reached the final round.*
